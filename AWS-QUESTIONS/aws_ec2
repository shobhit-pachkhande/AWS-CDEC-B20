**61. What is Hypervisor, and its types?**

*Answer:* A hypervisor is a software or hardware component that enables virtualization, allowing multiple operating systems to share a single physical host. Types of hypervisors include Type 1 (bare-metal hypervisors) installed directly on hardware (e.g., Xen, VMware ESXi) and Type 2 (hosted hypervisors) installed on top of an existing operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, VirtualBox).

**62. Where we use hypervisor?**

*Answer:* Hypervisors are used in virtualization scenarios, where they allow multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, each with its operating system.

**63. Steps to create an EC2 instance.**

*Answer:* Steps to create an EC2 instance include:
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click "Launch Instance" to start the instance creation wizard.
4. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
5. Choose an instance type.
6. Configure instance details (e.g., network settings, storage).
7. Add tags for identification.
8. Configure security groups.
9. Review and launch the instance.
10. Create or select a key pair for secure access.

**64. EC2 Instance state?**

*Answer:* EC2 instances have various states, including:
- **Pending:** The instance is launching.
- **Running:** The instance is active and running.
- **Stopping:** The instance is in the process of being stopped.
- **Stopped:** The instance is stopped and can be started again.
- **Terminating:** The instance is in the process of being terminated.

**65. How many types of EC2 Instance-State codes?**

*Answer:* There are several EC2 Instance-State codes, including 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shutting down), 48 (terminated), and more. Each code represents a specific state of the EC2 instance.

**66. What is the meaning of server hibernating mode?**

*Answer:* The hibernating mode is not a typical state for EC2 instances. However, it might refer to stopping an instance and utilizing EBS-backed instances, which retain the data when stopped, effectively putting the instance in a hibernation-like state.

**67. What is KMS?**

*Answer:* Key Management Service (KMS) is a fully managed service that helps create and control encryption keys for securing sensitive data in AWS. It integrates with various AWS services, including EC2, to provide a centralized key management solution.

**75. Difference between AWS AMI Image & AWS Template?**

*Answer:* An AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a pre-configured virtual machine image used to create EC2 instances. An AWS Template (like AWS CloudFormation template) is a text file defining AWS resources and their properties in a declarative format, used for infrastructure as code.

**76. What is NIC & its types?**

*Answer:* A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network. Types include physical NICs (built into the hardware) and virtual NICs (created for virtual machines).

**77. What is elastic IP? & WHY were we used?**

*Answer:* An Elastic IP (EIP) is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It is used to provide a consistent IP address for EC2 instances, facilitating applications that require a fixed IP or for instances that need to be moved between Availability Zones.

**78. What is the snapshot of why we use it?**

*Answer:* An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume. It is used for backup, disaster recovery, and creating new volumes. Snapshots are incremental, storing only the changed data since the last snapshot.

**79. How can we save money in snapshot costing, if an automated snapshot has been created?**

*Answer:* By using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to create and manage automated snapshots with defined policies, users can optimize costs. DLM allows control over snapshot frequency and retention, avoiding unnecessary costs.

**80. What is the lifecycle manager in a snapshot?**

*Answer:* The EBS Snapshot Lifecycle Manager automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots according to defined schedules, reducing manual management efforts.

**81. How does the Amazon lifecycle manager work?**

*Answer:* The Amazon EBS Snapshot Lifecycle Manager works by defining snapshot policies to create and manage snapshots. Policies specify how often snapshots are taken, how many to retain, and when to delete old snapshots, ensuring data consistency and efficient use of storage.

**82. Difference between Security Group & NACL?**

*Answer:* Security Groups are stateful and operate at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are stateless and operate at the subnet level, controlling traffic between subnets.

**83. What are NACL & Its types?**

*Answer:* Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are stateless firewalls at the subnet level. Types include inbound and outbound NACLs, each with rules defining allowed or denied traffic.

**84. How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances?**

*Answer:* The number of IP addresses an instance can have depends on its network interface. By default, an EC2 instance can have one private and one public IP address. For additional private IP addresses, secondary private IP addresses can be assigned.

**85. How many types of volume states do we have?**

*Answer:* EBS volume states include creating, available, in-use, deleting, deleted, and error.

**86. What is a key pair, and its types?**

*Answer:* A key pair consists of a public key and a private key used for secure communication with an EC2 instance. Key pairs can be created during instance launch or imported. Types include RSA and ED25519.

**87. What is a load balancer and its types?**

*Answer:* A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. Types include Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer.

**88. How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it?**

*Answer:* Load balancers distribute incoming traffic to multiple backend instances based on defined rules. They perform health checks on instances and direct traffic only to healthy instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

**89. Features of Load Balancers?**

*Answer:* Load balancers provide features such as automatic scaling, high availability, SSL termination, content-based routing, and health checks for backend instances.

**90. What is ASG? & Its types?**

*Answer:* Auto Scaling Group (ASG) automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on defined policies. Types include Simple Scaling and Step Scaling.

**91. What is a Health Check?**

*Answer:* A health check is a process by which a load balancer or Auto Scaling group monitors the health of instances. Instances passing the health check receive traffic, while unhealthy instances are replaced or removed.

**92. What is the threshold?**

*Answer:* A threshold is a predefined limit used in Auto Scaling policies to determine when to scale out (add instances) or scale in (remove instances) based on specific metrics.

**93. What is the group of LB?**

*Answer:* A group of LB refers to a collection of load balancers used for distributing traffic to multiple backend instances, providing redundancy and scalability.

**94. Why do we prefer ALB over NLB?**

*Answer:* Application Load Balancer (ALB) is preferred over Network Load Balancer (NLB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic as ALB operates at the application layer, providing more advanced routing and content-based features.

**95. Difference between Web server & Application server?**

*Answer:* A web server handles HTTP requests, serving static content, while an application server processes business logic, dynamic content, and often communicates with databases.

**96. What is the target group?**

*Answer:* A target group is used with Application Load Balancer to route requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, based on rules and health checks.

**97. What is the desired capacity in ASG?**

*Answer:* Desired capacity in Auto Scaling Group is the number of instances that ASG should maintain, ensuring that the group meets the desired state.

**98. How many types of Scaling options?**

*Answer:* Scaling options in ASG include manual scaling, scheduled scaling, and dynamic scaling.

**99. Scaling plans?**

*Answer:* Scaling plans define how ASG scales to maintain desired capacity, either automatically or based on specific schedules or conditions.

**100. Types Auto scaling**

*Answer:* Auto Scaling types include manual scaling (adjusting capacity manually), scheduled scaling (scaling based on time or date), and dynamic scaling (scaling based on conditions and policies).

**101. Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling?**

*Answer:* Vertical scaling involves adding resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server to increase its capacity. Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to distribute load, improving performance and redundancy.

102. **Difference between AMI & Snapshot?**

   **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
   - An AMI is a template that contains the necessary information to launch an EC2 instance, including the OS, application server, and application code.
   - It includes information about the root volume, block device mapping, and launch permissions.
   - AMIs are used to create EC2 instances and can be shared with other AWS accounts.

   **Snapshot:**
   - A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of the data stored on an EBS volume.
   - It captures the entire state of an EBS volume, including all the data and configurations.
   - Snapshots are often used for backup purposes, data recovery, and creating new volumes.

   **Difference:**
   - AMI is a higher-level concept that encompasses the entire machine image, including the OS and application stack.
   - A snapshot is a lower-level concept that specifically refers to a copy of EBS volume data at a certain point in time.

103. **What is the difference between EBS, EFS, and S3?**

   **EBS (Elastic Block Store):**
   - EBS provides persistent block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances.
   - It is ideal for use as a boot volume or for low-latency transactional workloads.
